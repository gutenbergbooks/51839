<p>This booklet is an enlarged and revised
reprint of two earlier booklets, one prepared
by Mr. Blake and the Reverend George L.
Crocket in 1936 as a part of the Celebration
of the Texas Centennial. The second booklet
was published in 1939 by the Nacogdoches
Historical Society and dedicated to
the memory of Dr. Crocket, who, among
the other labors of a singularly useful and
beneficient life, was an untiring student
of the history and traditions of East Texas.
Since he was one of the earliest workers
in the field, much material which would
otherwise have been lost was preserved by
Dr. Crocket&rsquo;s industry and enthusiasm.
The demand for information concerning Historic
Nacogdoches has been so great that
the supply has been exhausted. Many copies
have been furnished historians, school children,
historical societies and people generally
interested in the rich, historical background
of this area. This third edition was
financed by the Nacogdoches Chamber of
Commerce and will be supplied free upon
request.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small"><i>Nacogdoches The Indian Town</i></span></h2>
<p>For the beginnings of Nacogdoches we must go back to the shadowy
times when heroic figures march with majestic tread across the stage of
tradition, obscured by the mists of centuries. Having no written language
with which to record the glories of their race, the Tejas Indians recounted
the tales of their beginnings around their home fires, thus passing them
down from father to son through the long centuries before the coming of
the Europeans.</p>
<p>Thus it is recounted that in the days of long ago an old Caddo chief
lived on the bank of the Sabine, the river of the cypress trees. To him twin
sons were born: Natchitoches, swarthy of features with straight black
hair and flashing black eyes; and Nacogdoches, fair of complexion with
blue eyes and yellow hair. As the old man neared the end of his days, before
being ushered into the happy hunting-grounds, he called his two sons into
his presence to receive his final blessings. He commanded that immediately
following his death, Natchitoches should gather his wife and children
together, turn his face towards the rising sun, and after three days&rsquo; march
should build his home and rear his tribe; while Nacogdoches was instructed
to travel a like distance toward the setting sun, where he should rear his
children and children&rsquo;s children. Thus the twin tribes of Nacogdoches
and Natchitoches were founded 100 miles apart, and thus Nacogdoches was
the father of the Tejas, the white Indians of Eastern Texas.</p>
<p>The two tribes were a sufficient distance apart to prevent friction
over their hunting-grounds, and thus through the succeeding centuries they
were ever on friendly terms, the one with the other. This friendly communication
and barter between the tribes was such that they beat out a broad
highway between them and through their confines, which became El Camino
Real, extending from Natchez, on the Father of Waters, to the Trinity river
on the west, through Natchitoches, Louisiana, and Nacogdoches, Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_4">4</div>
<p>During the succeeding centuries the Tejas lived on the Redlands, building
comfortable homes around the ceremonial mounds which they had
erected, where they left their wives and children while they pursued the
bison, the deer and the black bear. Then another figure of heroic mold
emerges from the mists of the past, when Red Feather rules his people.</p>
<p>The story of Red Feather is delightfully recounted by Miss Adina de
Zavala, of San Antonio, Texas, in her &ldquo;Origin of the Red Bird.&rdquo; Red
Feather taught his people the gentle arts of husbandry&mdash;the cultivation of
Indian corn, beans, peas, melons and pumpkins; taught the women to make
preserves of the fruit of the persimmon tree, and to store the fruits of
the soil and the chase in their homes for winter. Great was the mourning
when Chief Red Feather died; while his subjects reverently laid his body
to rest on the chief mound in Nacogdoches, his spirit soared upward on the
crimson wings of the first red bird, and hovered in the majestic trees above
the mounds, as if guarding his people from danger.</p>
<p>Less than fifty years after Columbus sighted America, Hernando De
Soto, in the winter of 1541-42, penetrated as far west as Nacogdoches,
where he spent the winter, sending out scouting parties further west in
search for the seven cities of the Cibolo. He remained in Nacogdoches
because he found here a well-settled, hospitable Indian town, with an agricultural
population, having well-built homes, provided with comfortable
furnishings.</p>
<p>Nearly eighty years after De Soto&rsquo;s visit, on the borderline between
tradition and history, came the ministration of Mother Maria de Jesus de
Agreda, &ldquo;the angel in blue,&rdquo; teaching the Tejas tribes the Christian religion,
in 1620. So great was the influence of this saintly woman that in 1690 the
chief of the Tejas told Massanet that they wished to do as she had done,
and even wanted to be buried in blue garments.</p>
<p>The first definite description of Nacogdoches and its aboriginal population
is in the account of LaSalle&rsquo;s visit here in 1685. On this visit
Robert Sieur de LaSalle became desperately ill and remained in Nacogdoches
for a month, recuperating from disease. Here the Frenchman received such
hospitable treatment at the hands of the natives that four of his men deserted
and remained here when LaSalle started back to Fort St. Louis.</p>
<p>LaSalle found numerous evidences of prior contact with both French
and Spanish here. Perhaps the Indian traditions pointed to the presence
here of DeSoto and Coronado, and the traditional appearances of Mother
Maria de Agreda, already referred to.</p>
<p>DeLeon and his followers, in 1691-1692, made the first serious attempts
to educate the Tejas Indians in European ways by taking several of the
young members of the tribes back to the College of Zacatecas in Mexico.
Among these were two children of the chief of the Hainai Indians, living
near what is now known as the Goodman Crossing on the Angelina river,
about eighteen miles southwest of Nacogdoches. The young man, who afterwards
became head chief of the Hasinai Confederation, the Spaniards
named Bernadino, which name was also given to his father, the chief; the
young woman they named Angelina, and the river was named for her. She
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
also acted as interpreter between the Indians and the Spanish explorers,
including the followers of Captain Ramon in 1716, and those of the Marquis
de Aguayo in 1721.</p>
<h3 id="c3">First White Settlement</h3>
<p>The first permanent European settlement in the town of Nacogdoches
was made in June, 1716, when Fray Antonio Margil de Jesus founded the
Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe de Nacogdoches on what is now
North street, overlooking the valley of the Banito, &ldquo;little bath.&rdquo; The Spaniards
named the town Nuestra Senora del Pilar de Nacogdoches.</p>
<p>In the struggle between the French and Spanish for mastery of Eastern
Texas (called the Province of the New Philippines), the Mission Guadalupe
had an eventful history. Deserted at times but never permanently abandoned,
it finally decayed and its very site was utterly forgotten, though
the information concerning its location has been preserved in the ancient
Spanish parchments of our Nacogdoches archives.</p>
<p>When the Spanish settlers began making their homes in the old
Indian town, they found several mounds within the limits of the town, relics
of the centuries of Indian occupation before the coming of the white man.
Three of the larger of these mounds were located on what became the
Nacogdoches University campus, now the high school campus. The importance
of these mounds was not recognized by those who founded the
university, and they were razed in an effort to level the ground of the
campus. Only one now remains, on Mound street, so named because of
these monuments to the antiquity of the town. A large oak tree, whose
age has been estimated at about two hundred years, grows from the summit
of this remaining mound.</p>
<h3 id="c4">Nacogdoches&mdash;The Spanish Town</h3>
<p>With the French cession of Louisiana to Spain in 1764, the necessity for
the Spanish garrison in Nacogdoches ceased; and the town was abandoned
as a military post in 1773, to be refounded by Captain Antonio Gil Ybarbo
and his compatriots in 1779.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig1">

<br />

</div>
<p>The city of Nacogdoches, as a civic corporation, dates from that year,
in which that sturdy old Spaniard, Ybarbo, conducted his harassed and
bewildered followers from their experimental settlement of Bucareli on
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the Trinity river, to the old Mission of Guadalupe. The eastern boundary
of Texas was at that time a shadowy, uncertain quantity, somewhere between
the Sabine and Red rivers. Louisiana belonged to Spain, and the
government was but little concerned to mark out definitely the exact
limitation between its provinces.</p>
<p>Gil Ybarbo recognized the necessity of a commissary for the storing
of military and commercial supplies, and after applying to the authorities
in Mexico for such a building, and growing weary of the endless delays and
red tape, that industrious old Spaniard erected on his own account what
he and his followers called &ldquo;The Stone House,&rdquo; now generally referred to
as &ldquo;The Old Stone Fort.&rdquo; It was not erected primarily as a fort, but as a
house of commerce; and that has been its main use throughout its varied
history. But the construction of its walls&mdash;almost a yard in thickness&mdash;made
it practically impregnable to the ordinary means of offense; so that
it naturally became a place of refuge and haven of safety in the successive
perils that visited the old border-town.</p>
<p>Gil Ybarbo, ruling his people as a benevolent despot, was officially
known as Lieutenant Governor of the Eastern Province of the New Philippines
and Military Comandante of the Post of Our Mother of the Pilar of
Nacogdoches. He promulgated the first Book of Ordinances for the government
of the city in 1780, the original of which is now in the Nacogdoches
Archives in the Capitol at Austin.</p>
<p>The new city grew apace, and by the beginning of the Nineteenth
Century embraced a population of several hundred souls. In 1792 General
Don Ramon de Castro sent Don Juan Antonio Cortez, captain of cavalry at
LaBahia, to Nacogdoches for the purpose of conducting an investigation
of the irregularities of verbal land grants made by Ybarbo, as well as of his
illegal traffic with the French and Indians. The result of the investigation
was the removal of Ybarbo from his office; he was sent to Bexar while the
investigation proceeded. Don Carlos de Zepeda succeeded Ybarbo as Lieutenant
Governor, and in turn was followed by a succession of officials who
had charge of the public business of the town, and superintended legal
and commercial affairs, in addition to leading what military expeditions
were needed in their infrequent exigencies. Nacogdoches was at that time
the second largest town in Texas.</p>
<h3 id="c5">Philip Nolan</h3>
<p>In 1800 Nacogdoches was a loyal Spanish town, as was shown by the
part it took in the suppression of Philip Nolan&rsquo;s expedition. Nolan had
been reared by General James Wilkinson, commander of the United
States forces at Natchez, Mississippi. In furtherance of the schemes of
Wilkinson and Aaron Burr (then Vice President of the United States),
Nolan invaded Texas with a small band of adventurers, on the pretext of
horse-trading. The population of the town were largely behind Lieutenant
M. Musquiz and his Garrison, when they were ordered to pursue and arrest
the little band. Musquiz and his men were accompanied by William Barr,
of the trading firm of Barr and Davenport, who acted as interpreter between
the Spanish and Americans. Lieutenant Bernardo D&rsquo;Ortolan, a
Frenchman by birth, was left in charge of the garrison here while Musquiz
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
was on his expedition; during this time he conveyed titles to land to such
settlers as applied for them.</p>
<p>Nolan was overtaken on the banks of the Blanco river, at the block
house he had built, and in the ensuing engagement he was killed and the
remainder of the expedition were captured and brought back to Nacogdoches.
They were placed in the Old Stone Fort, from whence they were
taken prisoners to Mexico; the sole survivor of the band, so far as history
records, was Peter Ellis Bean, one of the most colorful and resourceful
men Texas has seen.</p>
<p>Correspondence found in the possession of Nolan enabled Musquiz to
discover various ramifications of the plot of Nolan, Burr and Wilkinson
among the inhabitants in Nacogdoches. One of the local leaders was a
Spanish woman, Gertrudis Leal, and her husband, Antonio Leal, who were
tried for treason by Musquiz. The priest in charge of Mission Guadalupe,
Padre Bernadino Vallejo, was also one of the conspirators, but the robes of
St. Francis saved him from punishment for his part in the plot. Samuel
Davenport was also found to be in some manner connected with the affair,
but he was shrewd enough to escape being tried, as was also a man by the
name of Cook, who then lived at Nacogdoches.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the new century the purchase of Louisiana by the
United States from the French, in consequence of the Napoleonic upheaval
in Europe, brought about a great change in the political and military affairs
of Nacogdoches. There was great jealousy between the two countries, and a
territorial dispute to be settled before the old status of somnolent peace
could prevail. The Americans built Fort Jesup, west of Red River, near
Natchitoches, and in 1806, Governor Cordero, with 1500 Spanish troops,
advanced to Nacogdoches to meet the American threat across the Sabine.
As a result of the negotiations of Governor Cordero and General Wilkinson,
there was formed The Neutral Ground, a strip of territory lying between
the Sabine and the Rio Hondo, over which neither government exercised
dominion, and which consequently became the rendezvous of the lawless,
until the settlement of the present boundary between Texas and Louisiana.</p>
<h3 id="c6">The Mexican Revolution Against Spain</h3>
<p>The next band of adventurers found Nacogdoches in a very different
temper. In 1810 the Mexicans rebelled against the government of Spain,
and Nacogdoches lost no time in assisting in the formation of the Magee-Gutierrez
expedition, under the leadership of Lieut. Augustus Magee, who
resigned his position in the United States garrison at Fort Jesup to take
command of the American and Mexican forces in their effort to throw
off the yoke of Spain.</p>
<p>It is said that every able-bodied man east of the Trinity river joined
in this expedition. For a time it prospered, and by 1813 had successfully
driven the Spanish military forces from Eastern Texas and pursued them
to San Antonio, where Governor Manuel Salcedo and most of the high
Spanish officials there were butchered.</p>
<p>One of the interesting incidents of this expedition, to the whole province
as well as to Nacogdoches, was the publication of two newspapers
here, the first ventures of their kind in Texas; the first of these, &ldquo;The
<span class="pb" id="Page_8">8</span>
Gazette,&rdquo; appeared in May, 1813, while the second, &ldquo;El Mejicano,&rdquo; was
published the following month.</p>
<p>Vengeance of Spain was swift, and the Spanish army sent into Texas
swept the inhabitants of Nacogdoches beyond the Sabine and into American
territory, where they remained until 1818-20. Erasmo Seguin was sent by
the new government of Mexico in 1821 to Nacogdoches to invite the old
settlers back to their former homes, as well as to welcome Stephen F. Austin
to Texas.</p>
<h3 id="c7">Dr. James Long&mdash;1819</h3>
<p>The settlement of the boundary dispute between the United States and
Texas on February 22, 1819, by fixing the Sabine river as the boundary,
met with strong opposition in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi, as well
as Eastern Texas. The American settlers had contended for the Neches
river as the true boundary, and Dr. James Long, who had married the
daughter of a wealthy planter at Natchez, Mississippi, lost no time in exploiting
his scheme of forming the Republic of Texas. Leaving Natchez June
17, 1819, with 75 men, he reached Nacogdoches with approximately
300, including Samuel Davenport, Bernado Guitierrez de Lara, and many
others who had fled in 1813.</p>
<p>Upon reaching Nacogdoches, Long&rsquo;s forces occupied the Old Stone
Fort, organized a provisional government, and issued a proclamation declaring
Texas a free and independent republic, and another newspaper&mdash;the
third in Nacogdoches as well as in Texas&mdash;was published by Horatio Bigelow.
It was called &ldquo;The Mexican Advocate.&rdquo;</p>
<p>It is very probable that Dr. Long&rsquo;s expedition would have been completely
successful if it had been organized a year later, after the revolutionary
movement had begun in Spain but in 1819 the royalists were in control
in Mexico; and that fact, together with Long&rsquo;s division of his forces
after leaving Nacogdoches for the West, so weakened his fighting units as
to cause them to fall an easy prey to the successive onslaughts of the
Spanish Army sent against him under Colonel Perez.</p>
<p>With the capture of his block houses and forts on the Brazos, Trinity
and Red rivers, Mrs. Jane Long, who had been left at Nacogdoches, fled
across the Sabine, and her husband soon followed, thus ending his first
attempt at freeing Texas, in October, 1819.</p>

<h3 id="c8">Nacogdoches&mdash;The Mexican Town</h3>
<p>Under the leadership of Alcalde James Dill Nacogdoches soon regained
its former prestige as the largest town in East Texas, and settlers from the
United States began coming in increasing numbers under the beneficient
colonization laws of the new government in Mexico; but things were much
changed. In 1825 Haden and Benjamin Edwards secured their ill-fated contract
as empresarios. When Edwards began to plant his colonists, sometimes
on land which had once belonged to the Mexican inhabitants and had
been abandoned temporarily in the flight of 1813, the friction between the
Americans and Mexicans increased. On the northwest of them also had settled
a tribe of Cherokee Indians, who claimed the right to occupy a vast
territory which had formerly been the habitation of the friendly Tejas
Indians.</p>
<p>This triangular situation bred distrust and antagonism that at last
broke out into open warfare, and threw the country into the wildest disorder,
in what is known as the Fredonian War in 1826. The coup of Edwards
was at first successful, and he and his followers were able to seize
the &ldquo;Stone House&rdquo; and fortify it; but the citizenship of Nacogdoches and
the surrounding country was not behind the movement, and it was doomed
to failure from its inception.</p>
<p>The Fredonian rebellion resulted in many of the prominent citizens of
the town being expelled in 1827&mdash;among whom were John S. Roberts,
Haden and Benjamin Edwards, Adolphus Sterne and Martin Parmer. The
Mexican general, Ahumada, who occupied Nacogdoches upon this occasion,
was a genuine diplomat, and with the assistance and advice of Stephen F.
Austin, who came to Nacogdoches with Ahumada, soon had the old town
peaceful again. However, the man whom Ahumada selected as comandante
here proved to be an unfortunate choice, and Colonel Jose de las Piedras
soon aroused the hostility of the American settlers with his high-handed,
arbitrary methods, as was the case with Col. Bradburn at Anahuac.</p>

<h3 id="c9">The Battle of Nacogdoches</h3>
<p>For the real cause of the Battle of Nacogdoches, we must go back to
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
Bustamente&rsquo;s Law of April 6, 1830, forbidding further immigration from
the United States, while permitting Europeans to come in unimpeded. Juan
Antonio Padilla had been appointed as commissioner general for granting
land titles in East Texas, assuming his duties on January 1, 1830. Upon
the passage of the law of April 6th, Padilla was unwilling to enforce its
provisions, and in the latter part of April he was ordered by Don Ramon
Musquiz, political chief in Bexar, to be imprisoned and suspended on a
trumped-up-charge of murder.</p>
<p>An outbreak was prevented in Nacogdoches only by prompt action on
the part of Col. Piedras, while the people of Ayish Bayou and the Palo
Gacho met and passed resolutions of an inflammatory nature. Stephen F.
Austin refused to cooperate in this opposition and thus for a time the
trouble was delayed.</p>
<p>The military force in Nacogdoches was doubled during 1830, and passports
of all immigrants going through Nacogdoches for Austin&rsquo;s colony,
which was exempted by Bustamente&rsquo;s Decree, were required to be signed
by Austin in person.</p>
<p>Under the dictatorship of Bustamente the military comandantes continually
encroached upon the power of the civil authorities, and finally, in
June, 1832, the settlers at Anahuac rebelled and ousted Bradburn, Piedras
arriving too late with troops from Nacogdoches and Fort Teran. Becoming
alarmed at the rising tide of opposition, Col. Piedras, upon his return, ordered
the people of Nacogdoches to surrender all their arms. This order
was followed immediately by an appeal from the ayuntamiento in Nacogdoches,
issued July 28, 1832, to the neighboring communities to present an
united front against this action; copies of this resolution were sent to
Ayish Bayou, the Palo Gacho, Tenaha and San Felipe de Austin and met
immediate response from all except San Felipe. Two companies came from
the Ayish Bayou settlement, commanded by Capts. Samuel Davis and
Bailey Anderson, one from Sabine and one from Shelby and Capt. James
Bradshaw&rsquo;s company from the Neches settlement; while the people of
Nacogdoches were led by Alcalde Encarnacion Chirino. On the morning of
August 2, 1832, these forces met in the eastern outskirts of Nacogdoches
and elected Colonel James W. Bullock as commander-in-chief of approximately
500 men.</p>
<p>Colonel Piedras commanded approximately the same number of Mexican
soldiers, and proceeded to fortify the Stone House, the old Catholic
church and the Red House. An Ultimatum from the settlers for Piedras to
declare in favor of Santa Anna and the Constitution of 1824, or surrender
at discretion to an officer to be selected by Colonel Bullock, brought forth
the answer that none of the demands would be complied with, and that
he was prepared to fight.</p>
<p>Colonel Piedras advanced to meet the Americans and the fighting
commenced in the eastern part of town about eleven o&rsquo;clock. By noon the
Mexicans had retreated to the business part of town, around the Stone
House. Alexander Horton, a member of the American forces, says: &ldquo;We
were armed with shotguns and various other guns such as citizens used
for hunting purposes, while the Mexicans were armed with splendid English
muskets; so we turned north and marched down North street. As we began
<span class="pb" id="Page_11">11</span>
our march we heard a French horn. When we had gotten about opposite the
Stone House the Mexican cavalry made a furious charge upon us, pouring
upon us a heavy fire of small arms; they advanced to within a few steps
of our lines, but were forced back with considerable loss.&rdquo; This cavalry
charge met the American force near the Catholic church, which had been
used by Piedras as quarters for his soldiers.</p>
<p>The Mexicans about mid-afternoon were driven out of the Stone
House, and the main body of their army was concentrated in the cuartel or
Old Red House, the older part of which was built of adobe, and almost as
strong as stone; it also had the advantage of several dormer windows on the
second floor, from which sharpshooters could better defend the building.
The fighting continued with unabated fury until night separated the combatants.
Colonel Piedras evacuated Nacogdoches during the night of the 2nd,
under the protecting cloak of a heavy fog, retreating westward toward the
Angelina river.</p>
<p>The next morning James Carter, with seventeen volunteers, set out in
pursuit of the Mexican army, overtaking them at Durst lake, and after a
skirmish at that point, Carter and his men went further south, crossing the
Angelina at the Goodman Crossing, and marched northward to the West
side of Durst&rsquo;s Ferry to oppose the crossing of the Mexican troops. Here
Piedras lost many of his men in an unsuccessful attempt to cross the
river. It was from this event that the name Buckshot Crossing was given
to this place.</p>
<p>During the following morning Colonel Piedras surrendered the command
to Captain Francisco Medina, who in turn declared for Santa Anna
and surrendered to James Carter the entire Mexican force of some four
hundred men.</p>
<p>Col. James Bowie, who reached Nacogdoches a few days after the
battle, agreed to convey the Mexican troops to San Antonio, and in his
report stated that there were 33 Mexicans killed and 17 or 18 wounded;
the Americans losing three men killed and seven wounded.</p>
<p>The Battle of Nacogdoches was the opening gun in the Texas Revolution,
and resulted in the expulsion of all Mexican troops from the territory
east of San Antonio, giving the Texans an opportunity to hold their
Convention without military interference of the enemy.</p>

</div>
<h3 id="c10">Growth of American Influence</h3>
<p>Nacogdoches now became more and more American in its character. In
<span class="pb" id="Page_12">12</span>
1834 the neighboring municipality of San Augustine was organized, and the
two sister towns grew in numbers and influence. Nacogdoches was the
capital of the department of the same name, and held jurisdiction over all
the region east of Trinity River. The alcaldes who presided over the civil
affairs of the municipality from the first reorganization in 1820 had usually
been chosen from among the Mexican people living there, but after the
expulsion of the Mexican troops in 1832 Americans were selected to fill that
office, and the town gradually assumed a character more American than
Mexican. American customs prevailed over those of former times, and the
business fell into the hands of enterprising merchants and tradesmen from
the States. The Indians to the northeast were impressed by the power and
vigor of the new people and left them unmolested, although they also had increased
until they greatly outnumbered the whites.</p>
<p>Business was thriving, the population was increasing, and new settlers
were coming into the town, or taking up land in the country. Commerce was
greatly aided by the communication with the other colonies in the interior,
and an era of prosperity seemed to have dawned. But in the midst of all
came more political troubles in the republic of Mexico. Santa Anna, by a
rapid series of measures, overturned the constitution of 1824, under which
the settlement of the province by Americans had begun. The guarantees of
liberty seemed to be disappearing. In Austin&rsquo;s colony there arose a &ldquo;war
party,&rdquo; which advocated resistance to these measures by force of arms.
Trouble began to arise at Galveston and at Anahuac. Still Nacogdoches
remained peaceful, hoping even against hope that all would yet be well.</p>
<h3 id="c11">War Clouds</h3>
<p>At length, however, the ambition of the Mexican dictator began to unfold
itself, and his designs against the lovers of freedom in Texas became
manifest. Even yet the mind of the people refused to move towards complete
independence. Delegates from the war party at San Felipe visited the town,
and by their persuasion at length convinced the people that it was in vain
to lie still any longer. Then East Texas was ready to act, and from Nacogdoches
and San Augustine armed soldiers set forth on the long march
across the State to the threatened region around San Antonio.</p>
<p>With the coming of Sam Houston to Nacogdoches in 1833, followed by
such men as General Thomas J. Rusk in 1835; with the backing of Colonel
Frost Thorne, Haden Edwards, Adolphus Sterne, Charles S. Taylor, John
S. Roberts, William G. Logan, Henry Raguet, Dr. James H. Starr, John
Forbes, Kelsey H. Douglass, Wm. B. Ochiltree and a host of others, Nacogdoches
practically financed the Texas Revolution, feeding and arming the
men pouring in from the United States to the defence of the new Republic.</p>
<h3 id="c12">Run-Away Scrape</h3>
<p>The tide of war never really rolled near to East Texas. For a time
General Sam Houston was accused of intending to flee through Nacogdoches
to the Sabine, where an American army was supposed to be expecting him,
but he had other designs, which were consummated on the field of San
Jacinto, and the danger was dispelled. East Texas, however, did suffer the
throes of a paroxysm of panic. It was known that Mexican agents were
<span class="pb" id="Page_13">13</span>
dispersed among the Cherokee and other Indians north of the settlements.
Reports, highly colored no doubt, were disseminated that these Indians were
about to move in an overwhelming body on the unprotected settlements,
whose men were in the field against the Mexican army, and wipe out town
and countryside alike. Fugitives from the devastated West, passing through,
helped to spread the terror, and so it happened that the &ldquo;Run-Away
Scrape&rdquo; came to include both Nacogdoches and San Augustine in the frantic
flight to safety beyond the Sabine.</p>
<h3 id="c13">The Republic</h3>
<p>The news of victory soon restored the minds of the people to sanity,
and they entered with alacrity into the work of establishing the new government
of the Republic. After the disorganization of the West and South,
which were devastated by the advance of the enemy. East Texas remained
in a position of leadership, and furnished perhaps more than its share of
the prominent officials of the Republic. The towns, including Nacogdoches,
were alive with the discussions of governmental problems, and the advocacy
of the names of the foremost citizens for high offices. After the repression
of Mexican domination, politics arose to unprecedented heights, and everybody
was affected by political fervor. Among the first officials of the new-formed
Republic, Nacogdoches furnished Sam Houston for President, General
Thomas J. Rusk as Secretary of War; Colonel John Forbes as Commissary
General of the Army.</p>
<p>Following the formation of the new government, the business men of
Nacogdoches entered upon a period of expansion, resulting in the laying out
of numerous new towns in the then Nacogdoches county, extending almost
to the Gulf of Mexico on the south and including Dallas on the north. Among
the towns thus formed following the Revolution may be mentioned Pattonia
south of Nacogdoches on the Angelina river, and a little further south the
town of Travis on the same river, Mount Sterling at the home of John Durst
on the Angelina river west of Nacogdoches, and a few miles further up the
river where the present highway crosses, the town of Angelina where
James Durst and his father, Joe Durst, lived. The original town of Rusk
was south of Nacogdoches where the road to Fort Teran crossed the Angelina
river on the Pierre Roblo grant. Thornville, near the present village
of Mahl; Liberty, a few miles northwest of Douglass; Jackson, built on an
island on the Attoyac not far from where Chireno was later founded.
Haden Edwards founded two towns north of Nacogdoches on the Sabine
river, near the present town of Longview, one of which was named Fredonia,
in memory of his ill-fated revolution, and the other he called Cotton-Plant.
In addition to these ghost towns of long ago, we may mention such
towns as Attoyac, Melrose, Chireno and Douglass, each of which was regularly
laid out in lots and blocks, in anticipation of the boom to come.</p>
<h3 id="c14">The Cordova Rebellion</h3>
<p>But the war was not over yet. The Mexican army had been defeated
and expelled, but there were enemies at home. The town of Nacogdoches
was aroused to feverish excitement when the preacher and congregation
of a country meeting came in one night with the news that the Mexican
population of the country had risen in arms under the leadership of a former
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
alcalde, Vicente Cordova, and were on the warpath against the American
citizens. General Rusk at once called for volunteers, and scouts were
sent everywhere to discover the whereabouts of the insurgents. All the next
day their efforts were in vain, but at length John Durst and a party of
scouts under him, came in with the report that they were encamped across
the Angelina river in what is now Cherokee county, where they were doubtless
waiting to join those Indians to make war against the American settlers.
Rusk appealed to the people of San Augustine and Sabine counties,
and within forty-eight hours they began to arrive, armed and equipped
for a campaign. After some delay, caused by contradictory orders from
President Houston, Rusk marched into the Indian country, where he found
that the rebels had gone to other tribes, and were beyond his reach. He
marched to the Cherokee and Shawnee villages and so impressed them with
the readiness with which he had assembled so considerable a body of soldiers
that they readily premised peace and disavowed any connection with the
Mexican insurgents.</p>
<h3 id="c15">Commercial Expansion</h3>
<p>In the meantime the town began to grow. It was the home of many
of the prominent leaders of Texas during the time of the republic, whose
influence was felt in the public affairs of the country. General Thomas
J. Rusk was a citizen of Nacogdoches until his death. Sam Houston frequently
was a resident until his removal to Huntsville. Charles S. Taylor
was very prominent in public affairs. William B. Ochiltree lived here for a
time. Thomas J. Jennings, the elder, lived here until his removal to Marshall,
as did Dr. James H. Starr. James Reily, who was minister to the
United States, had his home here. These are some of the men more prominent
in public life; among private citizens there were also many whose
names were well known throughout the land. Adolphus Sterne, Archibald
Hotchkiss, Henry Raguet and others might be mentioned. Of the county
officers Oscar L. Holmes, Richard Parmalee, Murray Orton, William Hart
and others were prominent. Colonel Haden Edwards, who returned to Nacogdoches
after the bitterness of the Fredonian rebellion had subsided, was
here until his death, and his family continued to live here for many years
afterwards.</p>

<p>The invaluable services of Nacogdoches and its people in opening up the
great northern regions of Texas, after the expulsion of the Indians, had the
result, unfortunate for it but inevitable, of diminishing the population and
importance of the town. New centers of agriculture and trade sprang up
and became towns which attracted more and more people to themselves, and
new opportunities presented themselves for business enterprise. It was
easier to fence in the prairies than to clear the forest lands of East Texas.
Many of the citizens of Nacogdoches, including some of the more prominent
persons, removed to other places.</p>
<p>After the annexation of Texas to the United States, Nacogdoches
gradually settled down to the station of one of the many flourishing towns
of the State, and lost the preeminence in political and social matters which
had been its lots from the beginning of its history. With San Augustine it
still continued to be the center of this section of the State, and the two
towns cooperated harmoniously in the development of the surrounding
regions.</p>
<p>Nacogdoches has always been an important social center. Even under
Spanish rule it was noted for the culture of its inhabitants, and during
the residence of the Governor of the State at this place in the unsettled
period after the Louisiana purchase, there was a social life here that was
not unworthy of a larger city. During the third and fourth decade of the
Nineteenth Century social amenities prevailed even through the confusion
of changing political scenes of that time. The Mexican officers at that
time were, as a rule, gentlemen, and the American immigrants included
many persons of high culture and attainments. After the revolution the
social standing of the place grew even stronger. It was not merely in entertainments
and enjoyments that Nacogdoches and San Augustine set the
pace in East Texas; they became centers of learning as well. Schools flourished,
and a refined taste in literary and scholastic affairs exhibited higher
ideals of mental achievements. The University of Nacogdoches was established
in 1845, and attracted many persons who were desirous of scholastic
training.</p>

</div>
<p>When the shadow of war fell over the country in 1861, Nacogdoches at
<span class="pb" id="Page_16">16</span>
once took her place among those who were ready to offer their belongings
and their lives upon the altar of their country. Her soldiers went to the
front and did gallant service for the cause of the Confederacy. At home,
the women and other non-combatants worked and prayed for the success
and safety of their loved ones far away on the battlefield. But war brought
ruin to the town; the schools were overwhelmed in the general desolation.
Business enterprise was at an end, and the great stores gave place to little
shops, which barely supplied the necessities of life. The soldiers came home
and went back to their farms, but the old plantations had disappeared and
the fields barely produced a living for their owners and workers. The town
itself was reduced to the proportions of an insignificant village. The people
bravely kept up the traditions of a more affluent existence, but it was a
mournful struggle against untoward conditions.</p>
<p>These conditions prevailed for twenty years, but at length a harbinger
of better times appeared in the shape of a railroad, the Houston East and
West Texas, connecting Houston and Shreveport. It was a narrow-gauge
road, burning wood for fuel and creeping along at an extremely low rate
of speed, but it was the first road to pass through East Texas, where formerly
the wagon and the two-horse hack formed the sole means of transportation.
It brought new business, new people and new ambitions to the
place which soon began to be built up in brick in place of the old wooden
houses of the earlier years. Soon cotton wagons assembled, bearing bales
of wealth, and in the autumn season the streets were filled with people
from surrounding counties selling their crops and buying supplies.</p>
<p>There was no boom. The town grew gradually and slowly. Greater
business enterprises were undertaken and accomplished and various kinds
of improvements were effected in the way of conveniences of living. For
many years the village spirit remained among the people. Everybody knew
everybody else, and each was interested in the welfare of all. New churches
were erected and a new court house and also, sad to relate, a new jail. A
large lumber mill was erected on the east side of town which added to the
prosperity of the place.</p>
<p>Finally, after the World War, when a number of new teachers colleges
were authorized by the Legislature, the enterprising spirit of the citizens
secured the location of that one named for Stephen F. Austin in Nacogdoches,
and the promise of cultured prosperity evinced in the days of the
Republic, but sadly interrupted by war, was at length realized. Nacogdoches
had now become one of the fairest of the little cities of Texas and bids
a hearty welcome to all comers within her borders.</p>
<p>And so we close the story of Nacogdoches under nine flags: The
Lilies of France with LaSalle in 1685; the Flag of Castile and Aragon of
Spain in 1716; the green flag of the Magee-Guitierrez Expedition in 1813;
Long&rsquo;s flag of the First Republic of Texas in 1819; the white and red flag
of the Republic of Fredonia in 1826; the flag of the Mexican Republic&mdash;1821-1836;
the Lone Star Flag of the Republic of Texas; the Stars and Bars
of the Southern Confederacy&mdash;1861-1865; and finally the Stars and Stripes
forever.</p>

<p class="pcap">THE OLD STONE FORT
<br />The above drawing was made from the earliest photograph of the Old Stone Fort. The
original picture has been re-photographed and the reproduction forms a treasured scene in
many homes of the city.</p>
</div>
<p>For one hundred fifty years tradition has thrown a veil of romance
around the old building that formerly stood at the corner of Main and Fredonia
streets, facing the northeast corner of the Plaza Principal in Nacogdoches,
where the two main branches of El Camino Real merged.</p>
<p>Even as early as Revolutionary days it was regarded by many as being
one of the old mission buildings, and later years this belief was strengthened
when a wandering sign painter, with the permission of John S.
Roberts, painted a sign for the front of his saloon in the old structure:
&ldquo;The Old Stone Fort, erected in 1719&rdquo;.</p>
<p>The Stone House, as it was called in the early records, has a history
more intriguing, more romantic, than any other building in the state of
Texas, not even excluding the Alamo. Over its walls all but one of the
nine flags of Nacogdoches have flown.</p>
<p>Built as a private enterprise by Antonio Gil Ybarbo in 1779, as a trading
post, it soon became the most important building in the New Philippines.
In 1801 Lieut. Musquiz brought Peter Ellis Bean and the remainder
<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
of Philip Nolan&rsquo;s expedition and placed them in the Old Stone Fort, where
they remained for thirty days.</p>
<p>Cordero, governor of the Province of Texas, together with General
Herrera and 1300 Spanish troops, had his headquarters in the stone house
when the treaty creating the &ldquo;Neutral Ground&rdquo; was agreed upon on November
6, 1806. For three months it was the seat of government of the
Eastern Provinces of Spain, when Governor Manuel de Salcedo was here
in the summer of 1810.</p>
<p>Magee and Gutierrez proclaimed their republican government from
the old building in 1813; as did Dr. James Long on August 14, 1819.
Again it became the capitol of the Fredonian Government, and on December
23, 1826, the Fredonian flag was raised over its walls.</p>
<p>Following the collapse of the Fredonian republic, the old building was
occupied as a home by John Durst, and the happy laughter of little children
resounded within its walls. Louis O. and Miss Benigna Durst were
born in the old house, inherited by Durst from his foster-father Samuel
Davenport, who purchased the property in 1806.</p>
<p>In 1831 John Durst moved to his new home on the Angelina river and
the Old Stone Fort was sold to Juan Mora, the district judge, and Vicente
Cordova, district attorney under the Mexican regime, in 1834. The official
records were again placed in the old building, where they remained
until a courthouse was built in 1840.</p>
<p>Within its walls the oath of allegiance was administered by the
Mexican authorities to such celebrities as James Bowie, Thomas J. Rusk,
Sam Houston and David Crockett. Around its walls the forces of Bustamente
and Santa Anna vied for supremacy on August 2, 1832, at the
Battle of Nacogdoches. Then in the spring of 1836, the stone walls of the
old building seemed a bulwark of safety to the few brave souls who refused
to flee from threatened Indian massacre in the Runaway Scrape.</p>
<p>On March 17, 1837, the first regular term of district court under the
republic assembled in the Old Stone Fort, followed by a special term in
August of the same year, presided over by &ldquo;Three-legged&rdquo; Willie, with a
pistol as his gavel, at which time General Thomas J. Rusk delivered one
of his famous orations, which has been preserved to us in our court
records.</p>
<p>Even the transfer of title to the old house from Vicente Cordova
brings an element of tragedy and in some respects even comedy. Cordova
was the leader in the so-called Cordova Rebellion in 1838, in which
Zechariah Fenley was murdered and one of his slaves taken away. Following
this, in 1840, Rebecca Fenley filed suit for damages against
Cordova, not for the death of her husband, but for the loss of her slave.
Cordova was a fugitive and a judgment against him for $1500 resulted in
a sale of his half-interest in the Old Stone Fort under execution, being
purchased by Rebecca Fenley, who was a daughter of Mrs. John S.
Roberts.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_19">19</div>
<p>The Old Stone Fort remained in the Roberts family until it was
purchased by Perkins Brothers in 1901; after which it was torn down, the
material given to the Cum Concilio Club of Nacogdoches, who used the
stones in the erection of the Stone Fort Memorial in 1907 at the northwest
corner of Washington Square, where it remained as a museum until 1936,
when the State of Texas again used the material from the Old Stone
Fort in the erection of the present Replica of the Old Stone Fort on the
beautiful campus of Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College at the
intersection of Griffith and Clark Boulevards.</p>

<p class="tb">THE MISSIONS AND PRESIDIO.&mdash;During the summer of 1716, under
the direction of Captain Don Domingo Ramon, three missions and a presidio
were erected in the present Nacogdoches county. The Presidio Nuestra
Senora de los Dolores, built in 1716, was repaired and enlarged by the
Marquis de Aguayo in 1721, and abandoned about 1730. Built by the
Spanish government as a fort and headquarters for soldiers guarding
the East Texas Missions and the borders of the New Philippines, it overlooked
Los Terreros or Mill creek, near the intersection of the Lower
Douglass road with the road from Douglass to Wells.</p>
<p>The Mission Nuestra Senora de la Purissima Concepcion was built 1.25
miles northeast of Goodman crossing of the Angelina river, near &ldquo;two
bubbling springs&rdquo; in the heart of the Hainai Indian village. In 1731 this
mission was moved to San Antonio where it now stands.</p>
<p>The Mission San Jose de los Nazonis was built 2.6 miles northeast of
the present town of Cushing, overlooking Dill creek. In 1731 this mission
was also removed to San Antonio, where it was called San Juan Capistrano.</p>
<p>Mission Nuestra Senora de Guadalupe was founded at the same time
on the west side of North street in Nacogdoches, overlooking Banito creek,
which was called &ldquo;the creek of the mission.&rdquo; This mission was never permanently
abandoned until it was replaced by the church which stood on the
little plaza in front of the present court house, built in 1802. The third
Catholic church was formerly the home of Nathaniel Norris at the northwest
corner of Hospital and North streets. The fourth church was the
Sacred Heart church on Pecan street, built in 1847 under the influence of
Bishop J. N. Odin; which was in turn replaced by the present Sacred Heart
church, built in 1937 on a portion of the homestead of Judge Charles S.
Taylor on North street, the house of the old Sacred Heart church being
rebuilt about eight miles south of Nacogdoches as the Fern Lake church.
The sites of the presidio and missions have been appropriately marked by
the State of Texas.</p>
<p class="tb">OLD STAGE STAND NEAR CHIRENO.&mdash;On Highway 21 about two
miles west of the town of Chireno is a very old house on the north side of
the road. It was built in the early forties of last century by Mr. James B.
Johnson, who was the first mayor of San Augustine. It was used as a halfway
station between San Augustine and Nacogdoches for the old Concord
coaches used at that time for mail and passenger service. Here the horses
were changed and passengers had meals. Another station on the same coach
line stands in the town of Douglass, fourteen miles west of Nacogdoches.</p>
<p class="tb">EYES OF FATHER MARGIL.&mdash;The old Spanish legend relates that
in the first year after the Mission Guadalupe was built there was a great
drouth and water was scarce. Father Margil went out in faith and smote
the rock on the bank of LaNana creek, which had completely dried up, and
two unfailing springs gushed out. They were called &ldquo;Los Ojos de Padre
Margil,&rdquo; The Eyes of Father Margil, and are located in what was formerly
known as Mims Park, now a pasture in the rear of the J. R. Gray residence.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_21">21</div>
<p class="tb">RESIDENCE OF PETER ELLIS BEAN.&mdash;One of the members of
Nolan&rsquo;s expedition; was captured by Lieut. Musquiz and held prisoner many
years in Mexico. During the Revolution under Morelos he made his escape
and joined the revolutionary forces. Settled in East Texas and had several
homes there. One of these was on the Carrizo creek, on the upper Melrose
road, four and one-fourth miles east of Nacogdoches. Marked by the
State of Texas.</p>
<p class="tb">OAK GROVE CEMETERY.&mdash;The State of Texas has placed granite
markers at the graves of the four signers of the Texas Declaration of Independence
who are buried in this cemetery: Thomas J. Rusk, Charles S.
Taylor and John S. Roberts, who represented the Municipality of Nacogdoches,
and William Clark, who represented Sabine District. The graves

of the forces that drove the Indians out of East Texas in
1839; Dr. Robert Anderson Irion, Secretary of State in the Cabinet of Sam
Houston, first president of the Republic of Texas, and Thos. Y. Buford.</p>

Battle of New Orleans. Came to Texas in 1821. Indian Agent under Mexican
government, lawyer in Alcalde court. Participated in the Texas Revolution
in 1836; noted for his private charities. Although the Constitution of Republic
and State both forbade the holding of land by negroes, Goyens
amassed a considerable fortune with his land deals and was owner of thousands
of acres of land at his death in 1856. His white wife, whom he married
in 1828, is buried by his side.</p>
<p class="tb">GRIFFITH PARK.&mdash;The park fronting North street and extending
from Caroline street on the south to the southern border of the campus of
Stephen F. Austin State Teachers College on the north. Given to the city
of Nacogdoches by the Griffith heirs in memory of Dr. L. E. Griffith and
his wife, Sarah Jane Clark Griffith, and Dr. Griffith&rsquo;s brother, Alfred.
Dr. L. E. Griffith came to Nacogdoches from San Augustine about 1850
and was one of the builders of modern Nacogdoches. The park was dedicated
to Dr. Griffith and the early pioneers of Nacogdoches.</p>
<p class="tb">INDIAN MOUNDS.&mdash;On the corner of the school campus at Mound and
Arnold streets, was a large Indian Mound 150&times;75 feet and about fifteen
feet high. On the corner opposite was a circular Mound about 75 feet in
diameter. These Mounds were leveled to make room on the campus. One
small mound still remains on the front lawn of the T. M. Reavley home.
An oak tree of considerable size grows from the summit of it. (See <a href="#fig11">back cover</a>).</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_22">22</div>
<p class="tb">OLD NORTH CHURCH.&mdash;About four miles north near Highway 35,
North Church was built in 1838, but the congregation had met for some
time before the house was built, under an oak tree, the lower part of the
trunk of which still stands. It was first known as Union church, being intended
for two bodies of Baptists as well as other denominations. It has
since become the property of the Missionary Baptists, who hold regular
services there. The old cemetery contains the graves of many of the early
settlers of Nacogdoches county. Marked by the State of Texas.</p>
<p class="tb">ADOLPHUS STERNE&rsquo;S HOME.&mdash;The old home of Adolphus Sterne

Catholic church in May, 1833. Now known as the Hoya home. Marked by
the State of Texas.</p>
<p class="tb">NACOGDOCHES UNIVERSITY.&mdash;The Nacogdoches University was
established in 1845, and at first occupied the &ldquo;Old Red House&rdquo; on Pilar
street. Later the Sons of Temperance Hall was acquired, and in 1856 the
present high school campus was donated to the University and given the
name of Washington Square. Two buildings were erected&mdash;a frame building
for the Female Department of the University, and a brick house for
the Male Department. The brick structure still stands in the center of
the group of buildings. Marked by the State of Texas.</p>
<p class="tb">EPISCOPAL CHURCH.&mdash;The first Episcopal Church stood on Church
street.</p>
<p class="tb">OLD SPANISH CEMETERY.&mdash;Where the courthouse now stands, was

Nacogdoches, among whom was Antonio Gil Ybarbo, founder of Modern
Nacogdoches. Marked by the State of Texas.</p>
<p class="tb">THE PROTESTANT ELM.&mdash;The noted Elm Tree stood immediately
east of the Southern Pacific freight depot and just south of a brick warehouse
now there. Henry Stephenson preached under this tree in 1819.</p>
<p class="tb">HOSPITAL STREET.&mdash;The old Spanish hospital, from which the
street derives its name, was situated on the corner of Pecan and Hospital,
in front of the Methodist church. Across Pecan street was the old Cabildo
or jail, built in 1835. Adjoining it on the west was the Hall of the Sons of
Temperance during the period of the Republic of Texas. On the block where
the First Presbyterian church now stands was the old Bull Ring, where
bull fights were held during the Spanish and Mexican regime.</p>
<p class="tb">THE OLD SOLEDAD.&mdash;Famous throughout East Texas prior to 1800
as the headquarters of William Barr and Samuel Davenport, Indian traders;
was located on the block on which the Texan Theatre now stands. Marked
by the State of Texas.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p class="tb">THE RED HOUSE.&mdash;About 1827 Colonel Piedras, comandante of
the Mexican garrison in Nacogdoches, built a house&mdash;part adobe and part
frame&mdash;on Pilar street in the block west of the Square, for the accommodation
of his officers and as headquarters for his forces. After the Texas
Revolution this house was sold under execution on a judgment against Colonel
Jose de las Piedras and became the property of Gen. Thomas J.
Rusk. General Rusk made his home there when he first came to Nacogdoches
in 1835, and remained there for eight or nine years. In 1845 the
University of Nacogdoches used it for class rooms. Later it was used
by various parties as an inn.</p>

<p class="tb">NACOGDOCHES COUNTY.&mdash;Marker placed by the State of Texas
three miles north of Nacogdoches on east side of Highway 35.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<h2 id="c18"><span class="small"><i>El Camino Real&mdash;The King&rsquo;s Highway</i></span></h2>
<p>The old King&rsquo;s Highway, known to the Spaniards as &ldquo;El Camino Real,&rdquo;
which runs through Nacogdoches, San Augustine and Sabine counties, was
followed by La Salle and his men in 1685, at which time they spoke of this
road as being &ldquo;as well beaten a road as that from Paris to Orleans.&rdquo; This
road was followed by St. Dennis in 1714, as he was making his way from
Natchitoches on Red River to San Juan Bautista on the Rio Grande. It was
doubtless an Indian trail to the western borders of the Tejas Indians, probably
about the Trinity river, and from there to San Antonio the best route
was determined by use. After the Mexican Revolution and the coming of the
American settlers it was straightened into a cart-road or Camino Carretera,
and was known as the Old San Antonio Road. State Highway 21 now follows
approximately the track of the old road.</p>
<p>Highway 21 leads east to San Augustine, the sister town to Nacogdoches
from the earliest days, where are the sites of the old Mission of Dolores,
the home of General James Pinckney Henderson, Governor O. M.
Roberts, and many of the prominent men of the Republic of Texas. The
home of Stephen W. Blount, signer of the Texas Declaration of Independence,
many of whose descendants live in Nacogdoches and San Augustine,
was built on the north side of the King&rsquo;s Highway, and is in an excellent
state of preservation.</p>
<p>Seven miles west of San Augustine on this highway was the home of
Thomas S. McFarland, who laid out the town of San Augustine in 1834. The
house was built about 1830 and was provided with port-holes for shooting
Indians in case of attack.</p>
<p>Pendleton Ferry was the original ferry on the King&rsquo;s Highway across
the Sabine river; now spanned by a splendid interstate bridge. Not far from
the road is McMahan&rsquo;s Chapel, the first Methodist Church in Texas, and the
site of old Sabine-town.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c19"><span class="small"><i>Masonic Lodge</i></span></h2>
<p>MASONIC LODGE.&mdash;Some time in the Spring of 1837, immediately
following the organization of a permanent government in Nacogdoches
county, a movement for the organization of a Masonic lodge began which
culminated in a dispensation from the Grand Lodge of Louisiana for
the Milam Lodge No. 40, which was dated July 29, 1837.</p>
<p>One of the leaders in the Masonic circles of Nacogdoches was Adolphus
Sterne, who was a past master of a lodge in New Orleans, and also
a 32nd degree Scottish Rite Mason, the first Scottish Rite Mason to come
to Texas. Haden Edwards was also a past master of another lodge. The
other charter members of Milam Lodge No. 40 were: Isaac W. Burton,
John H. Hyde, George A. Nixon, John S. Roberts, Charles H. Sims, Frost
Thorn, Simon Weiss, as Master Masons, and Kelsey H. Douglass and
John W. Lowe as Estered Apprentice and Fellow Craft respectively.</p>
<p>The first meeting of the Lodge under dispensation was held in the
Old Stone Fort on August 16, 1837, with the following present: Haden
Edwards, Master; John H. Hyde, Senior Warden; J. S. Roberts, Junior
Warden; Chas. H. Sims, Treasurer pro tem; Adolphus Sterne, Secretary
pro tem; with George A. Nixon, Simon Weiss and J. W. Lowe, members.
The Charter from the Grand Lodge of Louisiana was granted September
22, 1837, and was received in the Lodge on its meeting November 20, 1837.</p>
<p>Upon suggestions from Holland Lodge No. 36, Houston, Texas, a committee
consisting of Adolphus Sterne, I. W. Burton, Thomas J. Rusk,
Charles S. Taylor and Kelsey Douglass, was appointed to attend a meeting
in Houston to consider the formation of the Grand Lodge of Texas.
Their mission was accomplished in the city of Houston on February, 1838,
with the organization of the Grand Lodge of Texas, and this lodge became
Milam Lodge No. 2.</p>
<p>After the first meeting, the Lodge began using the upper floor
of Simon Weiss&rsquo; store for its meeting-place, and during its long history,
it held its meetings in several houses in Nacogdoches, but never succeeded
in building its own permanent home until the completion of its present
Temple in May, 1931, on North Fredonia street.</p>
<p>During the administration of Haden Edwards as Worshipful Master
of Milam Lodge No. 40, one dozen chairs were made for the use of the
Lodge, which were of hickory, turned on an old-fashioned lathe, with
seats of rawhide. These chairs served the Lodge long and faithfully, and
have witnessed the degrees conferred on every Mason made in Milam
Lodge for 110 years. In 1914 a resolution was passed, instructing the worshipful
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
master to present to the old past masters then living and to the
sons of those old pioneers that had passed away, one of these chairs, that
they might be kept as relics and mementos of the long ago. One of
them was retained by the Lodge and now occupies a prominent place in
the East, there to remain for all time to come, never to be used again
except it be by the President of the United States, the governor of Texas,
or the Grand Master of the Most Worshipful Grand Lodge of Texas.</p>
<p>Many of the men prominent in the affairs of Texas have been members
of Milam Lodge No. 2, and the minutes show Sam Houston a visitor
on more than one occasion.</p>

<p>The project of rebuilding the exterior of the
historic Nacogdoches University, as recently proposed
by the Nacogdoches school board, is now partially
completed.</p>
<p>The sum allocated by the board has been used
discreetly and the replacement of brick on outside
walls, new window frames and panes with new lumber
added supporting the antiquated structure,
guarantees safety to the public school children who
play on the hallowed ground of the Old Nacogdoches
University built by subscription with some state aid
during the days of the Texas Republic.</p>
<p>We feel that now is the time to emulate the
spirit of the pioneers. Let us be awakened to this
opportunity to complete the noble edifice, making
it available to be used by the citizens as a club
center and a museum.</p>

Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.</p>

<h3>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.</p>

<p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org.</p>

<h3>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary

<h3>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation</h3>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.</p>

<p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit <a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/donate">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.</p>

<p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.</p>

<p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>

<p>Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>

<h3>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.</h3>

<p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.</p>

<p>Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.</p>

<p>Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org</p>

<p>This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
